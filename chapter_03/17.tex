\begin{exercise}[]{}
Prove Proposition $3.16$. We suggest you start
by assuming dom($f$) has non-empty interior. In case
dom($f$) has no interior you should first extend $f$ to the affine hull
of the relative interior and then extend the extension to the whole space.
You may find it useful to use the fact that for
$y \in$ int(dom($f$)), $Df(y)[h]=\sup_{g \in \partial f(y) \siprod{g}{h}}$.
