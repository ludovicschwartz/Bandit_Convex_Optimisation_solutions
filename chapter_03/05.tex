\begin{exercise}[]{}
	Suppose that $ f \in \F_{sm,sc} $ and f is twice differentiable. Show that 
\begin{equation*}
	\alpha \mathbf{1}\preceq f''(x) \preceq \beta \mathbf{1} \text{ for all $ x\in int(K). $} 
\end{equation*}

\end{exercise}

\begin{solution}[]
	Since $f \in \mathcal{F}_{sm,sc}$, it holds that $g:x \mapsto f(x) - \frac{\alpha}{2}||x||^2$ is convex and $h:x \mapsto f(x)- \frac{\beta}{2}||x||^2$ is concave.
	Further more $f$ is twice differentiable which implies that $g$ and $h$ are also twice differentiable and it follows that:
	\begin{equation*}
		g''(x) \succeq 0\text{ and }  h''(x) \preceq 0  \text{ for all $ x\in int(K). $}
	\end{equation*}
	Remarking that $g''(x) = f''(x) - \alpha\mathbf{1}$ and $h''(x) = f''(x) - \beta \mathbf{1}$ yields the statement.
